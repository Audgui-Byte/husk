/**
 * What husk says to the model before anything else.
 *
 * The server's connect-time instructions open with "Husk gives you a Linux
 * computer", which is true for almost everyone and false on a Windows host
 * whose WSL is not working. This note is the only thing that corrects it, and
 * the model is the one party that cannot go and check: it never sees `husk
 * doctor`, it did not pick the provider, and it acts on this sentence.
 *
 * These assertions are about wording, which is unusual for a test. They are
 * here because the wording is the feature -- a note that names the shell
 * without naming the consequence sends a model into a retry loop against a
 * command that can never work.
