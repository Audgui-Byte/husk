/**
 * How doctor reports, with nothing real behind it.
 *
 * The assertions here used to live in `smoke.test.ts`, where they ran the real
 * binary against the real machine: docker, podman and wsl probed over a
 * subprocess. That test asserted only the *shape* of the report, so every
 * second it spent waiting on an external binary bought nothing -- and on a
 * loaded machine it took 890 seconds and failed. Fakes make it deterministic
 * and instant.
