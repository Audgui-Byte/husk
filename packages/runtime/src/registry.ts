/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Last use, for the providers whose engine does not record it.

   Docker and Podman answer "what exists?" from their own labels, which is why
   nothing above is written for them. But no engine records when husk last ran
   a command: `docker inspect` offers `State.StartedAt`, and that is when the
   container booted, not when it was last used.

   Reaping on `StartedAt` would not be a weaker idle timeout, it would be a
   different feature wearing its name -- a container busy for twenty minutes
   under `idleTimeoutSec: 600` would be destroyed mid-command. So the one fact
   the engine cannot supply is kept here, in a file per computer, and the
   engine stays the source of truth for everything else.

   A timestamp per file rather than one shared map: two `husk exec`
   invocations in different processes write concurrently, and a shared file
   makes that a lost update.
